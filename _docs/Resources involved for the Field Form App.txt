 Resources used to maintain and develop the code/application is Android Studio, version 
3.2.1.

 All the tools mentioned below can be downloaded for free at: 
https://developer.android.com/studio/

 Also, if you have an Android phone, you can plug it into a computer before the program 
compiles, by clicking the green button that looks like a play button and it will show you 
on your device, what the app will look like.

 Or you can download a virtual Android emulator within Android Studio, as you are 
compiling the program. Again by clicking the green play button in the middle of the 
toolbar section. This allows you to select a particular software version that is compatible 
with a particular phone and screen size. Then a mock phone pops up that runs your 
application.
